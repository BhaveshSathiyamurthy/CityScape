Game Modes
1.	Scenario Mode:
o	Objective: Players aim to complete all event cards in a specific urban scenario without depleting their resources.
o	Outcome: This mode simulates realistic urban planning challenges faced by city planners. It offers a platform for players to test various strategies and learn from the consequences of their decisions, thereby applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
2.	Collaboration Mode:
o	Objective: All players collaborate to develop the city while resolving event cards to gain contribution points. The player with the highest contribution points at the end of the game wins.
o	Outcome: This mode emphasizes teamwork, competition, and strategic planning, as players must work together to tackle urban planning issues while aiming for individual achievements.
Gameplay
The gameplay is divided into several structured phases, simulating the urban planning process:

1.	Canvas Phase:
o	Players draw up to 7 cards from the resource deck. If a "warning" card is drawn, it must be resolved immediately before continuing.
2.	Policy Phase:
o	Players can implement policies that influence city development. For instance, a player may introduce a "Reduce Pollution" policy, focusing on eco-friendly developments.
3.	Planning Phase:
o	Players decide to which zones to develop and move. For example, Player A may choose to build in the Commercial Zone, while Player B focuses on the Residential Zone.
4.	Development Phase:
o	Players spend resource tokens to construct buildings or infrastructure in their chosen zones. For example, Player A might build a "Shopping Complex" in the Commercial Zone, using 4 resource tokens.
5.	Event Phase:
o	An event card is drawn, introducing a scenario that impacts the city's development. For example, an "Economic Recession" event might decrease each player's resources for the next round.
6.	Growth Phase:
o	Resolve any card effects and revel blueprint card to replace any used cards

Rules
•	Players must draw from the resource deck and resolve any immediate warnings before progressing.
•	Players can only develop in zones decided during the Planning Phase.
•	Policy cards can only be implemented during the Policy Phase.
•	Resource tokens are limited, so players must strategize their spending to avoid running out.
•	The game ends when all event cards are resolved, or if a player runs out of resources, triggering a review of the city's development.
